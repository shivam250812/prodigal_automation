From our previous idea, we learned the importance of community engagement and affordability in online education. This insight led us to develop a platform that not only makes education more accessible but also supports creators by providing them with continuous earnings opportunities.

The high cost of quality education and unsustainable revenue models for creators are significant barriers that need innovative solutions. Our platform aims to provide continuous and affordable access to education while offering sustainable earnings for creators. This dual focus not only helps students access valuable learning resources but also supports creators in monetizing their content effectively.\n\nWe have domain expertise in this area, as our team comprises individuals with backgrounds in education technology, digital content creation, and community engagement. This expertise allows us to understand the nuances of the challenges faced by both students and creators, enabling us to design a solution that meets their needs effectively.\n\nWe know there is a demand for what we're making because of the evident gaps in the current market. The issues of high premium course fees, limited financial aid, and minimal peer interaction highlight the need for a more inclusive and engaging platform. Additionally, the challenges creators face with one-time sales models and piracy issues indicate a need for more sustainable revenue streams. Our engagement with potential users and stakeholders has further validated the demand for a platform that bridges these gaps, ensuring continuous access and community engagement.",

Additionally, Linkup might have a distinct GTM (Go-To-Market) strategy that leverages unique marketing tactics, partnerships, or educational campaigns that differentiate it from Coursera and Udemy.

    "question": "How do or will you make money? How much could you make?",
    "ai_answer": "Based on the provided context, the business model for generating revenue includes several streams:\n\n1. **Transaction Fees**: The platform charges fees on transactions, likely when users purchase or resell courses. This is a common revenue model in platforms that facilitate transactions between users.\n\n2. **Premium Features**: Users can pay for additional features that enhance their experience on the platform. This could include advanced tools, analytics, or exclusive content.\n\n3. **Subscriptions**: The platform offers subscription plans, possibly for both students and creators, providing continuous access to content or premium services.\n\n4. **Corporate Plans**: These are likely tailored packages for businesses or educational institutions that want to use the platform for training or educational purposes.\n\nRegarding potential earnings, the market opportunity is significant. The global EdTech market is projected to reach $404 billion by 2025. Given that there is currently no major platform offering course resale with community engagement, this unique value proposition could capture a substantial market share. However, the exact earnings would depend on the platform's ability to attract and retain users, the pricing strategy for its services, and the overall market conditions.",
